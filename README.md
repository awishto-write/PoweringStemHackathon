# HealthPowerUp: PoweringStemHacks

# Inspiration
     In the world, healthcare is important and essential. Workers in that field have high-stress jobs, they work hard and when they make a mistake, it impacts a lot of things/people. That stress level increased with Covid-19 and all the associated issues. For that level of stress, workers in that field are not offered emotional support or programs to help them destress. Many people in healthcare want to quit for something else, most of the time when we go to the hospital, the waiting time is long because there is not enough staff. So, we wanted to create something that might encourage workers in healthcare to stay on the path they are already and increase awareness about type 2 Diabetes because most people are unaware of that condition.

# What it does
Simply Green Lenses educates people about the problems that the environment and all living creatures are facing. It calculates an individual's carbon footprints to inform the individual about his contributions to the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) It also provides solutions to help us reduce GHG.
  HealthPowerUp is a website where healthcare workers can have free therapy and also participate in free social events. This website is also mainly made for people sick at the hospital who cannot be outside like most people so that they may gather online to participate in free social events and help them relax and not think so much about their medical conditions. Also, gathering with people that can understand them can be good emotional support, not to forget that they can also have free therapies. Additionally, this project targets the main disease which is Type 2 Diabetes, the site educates people through informational slides about a quiz that tests their knowledge about it. Hopefully, the more informed people are, the better it can help them.
